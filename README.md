**Suicide**
=============
The purpose of this Spigot plugin is to allow OPs or players with the correct perms to kill their own in-game player. Of course, if keep inventory is off, upon issuing the command, not only will the player die, but they will also lose their inventory.

I thought I should put this here in case anyone might be actually looking for it. Suicide in real life is never worth it, and I want to be here to help. I know you might have heard this multiple times already, but I can guarantee you that taking your own life will never ever be worth it in the long run. Please, if you need someone to talk to, my email is below and always remember that the number for the USA Suicide Hotline is 1-800-273-8255 and their website is https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org. If you do listen to me and hopefully save yourself, I applaud you and please do know that even though it may not look like it, there is a place for you in society and people really do need you out there. Additionally, people do care for you, like me, so please, let me or others help you if we can. Thanks!
